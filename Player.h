 Player.h - master
 
    Notes about Class:
 
    This class stores all information about players:
        - ID
        - Name
        - total Gamerscore
        - record of Games the player plays
        - record of friends list. I chose to only store the IDs in this so I wouldn't have
            to deal with data being copying over and repeated in multiple locations
 
    In Main, I have the player database ordered by ID so when I need to find a specific player
       I can use the binary search algorithm to quickly find that person
