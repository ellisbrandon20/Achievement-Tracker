    Notes about Class:
 
    The class stores all the information about Players Gameplay of a specific game
        - playerIGN = the palyers username for the game
        - gamePlayID = the gameID that the user played
        - awardedAchievements = record of achievements the player earned when playing this game
    
    I kept these stored in order by gamePlayID to so I can use binary search algorithm
      when I needed to locate a specific item
